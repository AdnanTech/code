# MSYS2

 **MSYS2** is a collection of tools and libraries providing you with an easy-to-use environment for building, installing and running native Windows software.

MSYS2 uses a **terminal** called [**mintyy**](https://mintty.github.io/)**,** bash \(also consists of other tools\) that consists of a collection of libraries to build systems. It is an extension of [**Cygwin**](http://cygwin.com/)**.** The point of MSYS2 is that it provides a _Linux like terminal, but on windows_. This is useful because it allows for ubiquity between operating systems. As well as a better vim editor from a better terminal.

It uses the package manager [**pacman**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman). Pacman has a lot of features such as **dependency resolution** and simple **complete system upgrades**, as well as straight-forward and **reproducible package building**.

It also apart of my portable developer environment.
