# General Notes



*  Global variables can be decalred above the main function
*  Constants can also be decalred by saying const
*  void functions can be called via void function\_name\(parameters\)
*  \#include &lt;iostream&gt; std::cout &lt;&lt; someString &lt;&lt; "\n"; is a different way of printing - this doesnt work in c, only c++ also try cout &lt;&lt; str;
*  arrays must be defined in length, if you are storing them later on, or you can define the length if you define the array on the same line
*  asterixes are used \(\*\) to represent a pointer to a memory location, NOT the value
